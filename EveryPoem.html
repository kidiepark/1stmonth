    <h4 id="hc1">Hello my Yashtine, You know how much I love you right? Happy 2nd monthsary to our blooming and growing love!
        <br>I always want to be with you and only you my baby no one, nobody else only my Yashtine.
        <br>I'll wait for how long, may it be eternity or until the world disintegrates, I do not care as long as I get to be with you.
        <br>I am so glad and happy that we're now together after all the pain and misunderstandings that we both went through.
        <br>I wish for nothing else but an eternal and happy life with my Yashtine, a life where I can touch you, kiss you and tell you close to your face and ears how I will always and how much I love you.
        <br>I hope you know in my every morning, night, afternoon at whatever may it be I am doing, it's always you I think about.
        <br>You're my rest in my tiring days, you're my home, you're my freedom, you're the love of my life.
        <br>My Yashtine, I love you and I always will until the very existence of mine is gone.
        <br>Telling you how much I love you is never tiring, loving you is never tiring, giving you my all is not tiring because in the end of the day, I know you are worth everything.
        <br>I will never get tired of loving you, I will always reassure you how much I love you.
        <br>Yashtine, in this life of mine, I only want you.

    </h4>
    
    <h5 id="hc2">How time flies by so fast when loving someone genuinely.
            <br>Can you believe it my baby? 2 months have already passed.
            <br>But it felt like we've met for more than years and since we were born.
            <br>You're the only person I will never regret and forget.
            <br>You made me realize that loving someone doesn't need to be always close and there physically.
            <br>I don't give a damn about our distance, for the reason that I can wait for you.
            <br>I only want your love, attention and affection nobody else.
            <br>Yashtine you are the one I will always look for.
            <br>When I'm lost you're my guide, when it's dark you're my light.
            <br>I'm always thankful and grateful because I have you, Yashtine I love you.
            <br>No matter where this life takes me, I know I will always come back to you, fall towards you and only you.

        <h5 id="hc3">Isn't it crazy how we can talk about our future so easily?
            <br>I myself know for you, I am always ready.
            <br>Does it matter when you feel like you're going crazy?
            <br>
            <br>My love for you will never be led astray.
            <br>I promise you beside you I will forever stay.
            <br>Our Relationship and Love to last long for I will always pray.
            <br>
            <br>How I wish everyday to see you.
            <br>I've always wanted to feel your touch.
            <br>My dreams are always about you.
            <br>
            <br>Whenever I speak, your name comes out.
            <br>Has there ever been A day I haven't thought about you?
            <br>One day I will always be beside you, skin to skin, eye to eye.
            <br>
            <br>I just know one day distance won't be a problem.
            <br>Because we don't care how long it takes.
            <br>If we see each other I won't be giving you any breaks ;)
            <br>
            <br>I love you so much my Yashtine.
            <br>In my whole existence I want nothing but only my Yashtine.
            <br>You are my everything, you deserve everything.
            <br>
            <br>Within those months we've been talking.
            <br>Finding you was not random, we both made it happen and it's not just a random timing.
            <br>Fate knows we're both for each other in this existence.
            <br>
            <br>From the very start, I already knew you're going to be mine.
            <br>Our love and relationship is going to be strong and sublime.
            <br>I will wait until this very existence and soul of ours combine.
            <br>
            <br>I'm so glad and happy you're mine.
            <br>I know what I'm saying is redundant, but I'll never get tired of telling you that I love you and you are worth everything.
            <br>I will always find you beautiful, smart, amazing and as always fascinating.
            <br>
            <br>I love you so much my baby!
            <br>Happy 2nd monthsary!
            <br>I'm going to have you for the rest of my life and marry you, I want nothing else but you.
